Available at: https://youtu.be/EspJv_Zbwq0

This video explains the operation of a voltage-source grid-tied inverter. A detailed explanation on how to design the closed-loop compensator is presented. Several LTspice simulations are shown to support the different explanations. Grid-tied inverter are useful in renewable energy applications in which we want to send energy from a solar panel or wind generator to the grid.
